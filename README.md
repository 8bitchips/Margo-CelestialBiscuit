Margo is a product created uniquely for females to track their periods, notify their loved ones about their mood, discuss and chat with other females for common menstrual issues and shop for menstrual hygiene products. 
<br><br>
Margo was initiated because one of our teammate experienced distress during her menstrual cycle and all she wanted was to listen to some good music and talk to her friends. 

## PASSWORDLESS AUTHENTICATION USING SAWOLABS API 

Margo is powered by passwordless authentication system of **SawoLabs API**. Users get to experience a hassle-free login system by just entering their email addresses and the one time password they receive on their emails. No more remembering and forgetting passwords! 

## PERIOD TRACKER 

The period tracker is one of the main features of this application. It offers you a nice visual display and keeps a track of your menstrual cycle, predicts your next menstrual cycles and offers you a chance to edit your cycle and period length. 

## PAMPER BOOTH 

The pamper booth has specially been built because each woman deserves everything. When women are menstruating, the pain of the period cramps becomes unbearable at times. The pamper booth offers two unique features: 
1. **Mood based playlists** : Spotify playlists are generated based on the mood you have for the day. There are four options to choose from - in pain, okayish, good and, like a queen. 
2. **Notifying your loved ones** : There is an option to email your loved ones by typing their email in the input form. An email with instructions on how you can take care of your loved one will be sent to that email address.  

## DISCUSSION FORUM 

The discussion forum is powered by a custom built API by the team which is powered by **machine learning** where profane words have been censored. The aim of this discussion forum is to create a safe space for all the ladies to openly discuss their issues and concerns regarding their menstrual health and hygiene. 
<br> 
The discussion form is primarily built on the belief of "one for all and all for one". 

## MENSTRUAL BLOG 

We have built another API which grabs articles from the internet regarding menstrual hygiene and displays them on our website to increase the awareness and the knowledge of the women visiting our web application. 

## SHOP 

The Margo shop is home to a plethora of products. Excellent quality sanitary napkins, pantyliners, menstrual cups, tampons, intimate washing solutions and a lot more available at the best prices here. The shop is going to function like any other e-commerce platform which becomes the basis of our **business model**. 

## VIDEO CALL USING AGORA.IO API

To offer the women a chance to connect with their loved ones and/or someone from the discussion forum, we have integrated instant video calling system using agora.io API where one user can call the other user and upon the acceptance of the call, both of them will be connected and can have a live discussion amongst themselves.
